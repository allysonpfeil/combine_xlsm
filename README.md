# combine_xlsm

I didn't write this, but I use it often and will summarize its function.
This code will take data from Excel, combines it into a word doc, and names the new file after the name and date of surgery. 
The script will take all the similar data from columns A-D and combine it. After combining, it will output this data to a new word doc and delete the data from Excel.
